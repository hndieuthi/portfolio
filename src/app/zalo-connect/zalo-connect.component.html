        During the COVID pandemic in Vietnam, Zalo Connect, a mini-app within
        Zalo, gained popularity by finding assistance and connecting small
        businesses to households to buy food, utilities and medicine under
        restrictions. However, as the pandemic receded and restrictions were
        lifted, Zalo Connect faced challenges in finding a new direction and
        establishing its own unique branding.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite these challenges, we remained optimistic about the app's
        potential to continue to expand and support small business owners who
        are active on Zalo.

        Insights from user data indicates a promising marketplace

      <ul>
        <li>
          Over 2.7 million active users utilize their Zalo profiles to sell
          their products, creating a massive C-commerce marketplace within the
          Zalo social network.
        </li>
        <li>
          Users frequently sell various products depending on the season and
          post their listings actively on their own profile, averaging 2-6 posts
          per day.
        </li>
        <li>
          Many sellers form wholesale groups to distribute products to
          retailers. These groups are some of the largest and most active on the
          platform, indicating a thriving marketplace.

            Each shop has a single profile with a field of description to write
            down all of their products and shipping information. These profiles
            are grouped into feed based solely on user location. Since the shop
            profiles and pictures remain the same for a long period on feed,
            <b>users are discouraged from exploring new content</b>.
          </p>
          <p>
            To update listings , sellers need to submit a new profile and wait
            up to 24 hours for approval. This system was put in place during
            COVID-19 restrictions but has become outdated as sellers now have
            access to a wider range of products and update their listing daily.

      <p>
        Food is now the main focus of Zalo Connect, with an emphasis on
        specialties and fresh ingredients. Users can message sellers to buy
        products and get more information, just as they usually did.
      </p>
      <p>
        Previously, users needed to be friends with sellers on Zalo to see
        product listing on their profile. With Zalo Connect, users can discover
        more products nearby without being friends with sellers.
      </p>
      <img src="{{ imagePath }}/zalo-connect12.png" />
      <h2 class="mt-80 h3 semi-bold">A brand new look</h2>
      <p>
        After conducting several interviews with the seller, it was apparent
        that the branding needed to be updated to better align with their image
        and message. We chose a more playful and cheerful approach, using
        vibrant colors that accurately represent the seller's values and
        personality, while keeping the core of Zalo branding.

        To comply with the new safety regulations, sellers must follow steps to

        helps users easily register new shops. One of the challenges we face is
        how to deal with:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Shops on the old version of Zalo Connect wanting to migrate to the new
          version
        </li>
        <li>
          Shops selling non-food products or a combination of food and other
          products, now wanting to migrate to the new version
        </li>
        <li>
          New regulation requiring identity verification for each shop,
          resulting in a mix of unverified old shops and verified new shops on
          the platform
        </li>
        <li>
          New regulation requiring a shop registration approval process,
          conducted by a safety team, which typically takes a maximum of 24
          hours to approve
